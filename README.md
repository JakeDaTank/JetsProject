# Jets Project 
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Jacob Paul, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 weekend homework project. The key topics of this week are:
* OO Development and implementation
* Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Initially I set up my classes by drawing everything out in UML and then generated them along with
* my field variables and their getters and setters.
* Set up the Interface "SuperSonic" for jets that travel above the sound barrier in order to warn people
that supersonic jets must remain Subsonic while in city limits.
