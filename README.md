# Jets Project 
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Jacob Paul, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 weekend homework project. The key topics of this week are:
* OO Development and implementation
* Inheritance
* Interfaces
* Initially I set up my classes by drawing everything out in UML and then generated them along with
* my field variables and their getters and setters.
* Set up the Interface "SuperSonic" for jets that travel above the sound barrier in order to warn people
that super-sonic jets must remain sub-sonic while in city limits.
* I wasn't able to get the Interface to work on my own however I hope to get it working in the morning and do another submission, however at this point I have a working finished program.
* Although My program could be more efficient, I worked hard to include as many new tools as possible in its 
design such as a switch in order to create a new aircraft
